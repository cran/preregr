<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Preregistration is the act of submitting a study plan, ideally also with analytical plan, to a registry prior to conducting the work. Preregistration increases the discoverability of research even if it does not get published further. Adding specific analysis plans can clarify the distinction between planned, confirmatory tests and unplanned, exploratory research.</p>
<p>This preprint contains a template for the “OSF Prereg” form available from the OSF Registry. An earlier version was originally developed for the Preregistration Challenge, an education campaign designed to initiate preregistration as a habit prior to data collection in basic research, funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (now Arnold Ventures) and conducted by the Center for Open Science. More information is available at <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg" class="uri">https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg</a>, and other templates are available at: <a href="https://osf.io/zab38/" class="uri">https://osf.io/zab38/</a></p>

<p>Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness.</p>
<strong>More info</strong>: The title should be a specific and informative description of a project. Vague titles such as ‘Fruit fly preregistration plan’ are not appropriate.

</div>
</div>
<div class="preregr-item-spec-text">
<p>Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the study, or broad research questions.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry.</p>
<strong>More info</strong>: The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration.

For studies that donÍt include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Participants will be recruited through advertisements at local pastry shops.

A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that transparency is more important than principled justifications.

<p><strong>Example</strong>: We manipulated the percentage of sugar by mass added to brownies. The four levels of this categorical variable are: 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40% cane sugar by mass.</p>
<strong>More information</strong>: For any experimental manipulation, you should give a precise definition of each manipulated variable. This must include a precise description of the levels at which each variable will be set, or a specific definition for each categorical treatment. For example, “loud or quiet,” should instead give either a precise decibel level or a means of recreating each level. ‘Presence/absence’ or ‘positive/negative’ is an acceptable description if the variable is precisely described.

<p>Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: The single outcome variable will be the perceived tastiness of the single brownie each participant will eat. We will measure this by asking participants ‘How much did you enjoy eating the brownie’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘not at all’, 7 being ‘a great deal’) and ‘How good did the brownie taste’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being ‘very bad’, 7 being ‘very good’).</p>
<strong>More information</strong>: Observational studies and meta-analyses will include only measured variables. As with the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. For example, ‘intelligence,’ ‘accuracy,’ ‘aggression,’ and ‘color’ are too vague. Acceptable alternatives could be ‘IQ as measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale’ ‘percent correct,’ ‘number of threat displays,’ and ‘percent reflectance at 400 nm.’

<p>If any measurements are going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If your are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of ‘brownie enjoyment.’</p>
<strong>More information</strong>: If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable, how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as “means” do not require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For example, “biodiversity index” is too broad, whereas “Shannon’s biodiversity index” is appropriate.

<p>What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis?

Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: We will use a one-way between subjects ANOVA to analyze our results. The manipulated, categorical independent variable is ‘sugar’ whereas the dependent variable is our taste index.</p>
<strong>More information</strong>: This is perhaps the most important and most complicated question within the preregistration. As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the same analysis again with the information provided by the user? Be aware for instances where the statistical models appear specific, but actually leave openings for the precise test. See the following examples: 1) If someone specifies a 2x3 ANOVA with both factors within subjects, there is still flexibility with the various types of ANOVAs that could be run. Either a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) or a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) could be used for that design, which are two different tests. 2) If you are going to perform a sequential analysis and check after 50, 100, and 150 samples, you must also specify the p-values you’ll test against at those three points.

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The “Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness” does not require any additional transformations. However, if it were using a regression analysis and each level of sweet had been categorically described (e.g. not sweet, somewhat sweet, sweet, and very sweet), ‘sweet’ could be dummy coded with ‘not sweet’ as the reference category.</p>

<p>What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information youÍll use (e.g. p-values, bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: We will use the standard p&lt;.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test adjusts for multiple comparisons.</p>
<strong>More information</strong>: P-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes are standard means for making an inference, and any level is acceptable, though some criteria must be specified in this or previous fields. Bayesian analyses should specify a Bayes factor or a credible interval. If you are selecting models, then how will you determine the relative quality of each? In regards to multiple comparisons, this is a question with few “wrong” answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is acceptable.
