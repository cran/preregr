    Intended Use:
      heading: Intended Use
      description: This Inclusive General-Purpose Registration Form is intended as
        a general-purpose registration form. The form is designed to be applicable
        across disciplines (i.e., psychology, economics, law, physics, or any other
        field) and across study types (i.e., qualitative studies, quantitative studies,
        experiments, systematic reviews, case studies, archive studies, comparative
        legal studies, or any other type of study). This form, therefore, is a fall-back
        for more specialized forms and can be used if no specialized form or registration
        platform is available. As such, if at all possible, it is recommended to avoid
        using this form and instead use a specialized form. This inclusive general-purpose
        registration form achieves that inclusiveness and general-purposeness at the
        cost of specificity and comprehensiveness. Still, if specialized forms don't
        fit for your study, this form may be a good backup.
