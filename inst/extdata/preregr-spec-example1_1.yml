    Intended Use:
      heading: Intended Use
      description: This Inclusive General-Purpose Registration Form is designed to
        be applicable across disciplines (i.e., psychology, economics, law, physics,
        or any other field) and across study types (i.e., qualitative studies, quantitative
        studies, experiments, systematic reviews, case studies, archive studies, comparative
        legal studies, or any other type of study). This form, therefore, is a fall-back
        for more specialized forms and can be used if no specialized form or registration
        platform is available. As such, if at all possible, it is recommended to avoid
        using this form and instead use a specialized form. This inclusive general-purpose
        registration form achieves that inclusiveness and general-purposeness at the
        cost of specificity and comprehensiveness. Still, if specialized forms don't
        fit for your study, this form may be a good backup.

        but that took less central roles in informing the study's design. Note that

        associations or effects, list the variable(s) that theoretically cause them
        or are assumed to otherwise explain the main variable(s) / dependent variable(s)
        / outcome(s). If this is a manipulation, treatment, or intervention, make
        sure to describe it in full: that means also describing all groups, including
        any control group(s) or comparator(s). If there are no secondary variables,
        you can just state that.'

      item_description: Here, list any additional variables you are interested in

      item_label: Data origin
      item_description: 'Describe the origin of the data you will examine. Data here
        is meant as a broad term: it refers to primary or secondary data; data you
        will collect or data that already existed; data that are measurements, recordings,
        existing documents or reports. Basically, which bits of the world will you
        look at to answer your research question(s), and how will you obtain those
        bits? For example, will you study humans, animals, chemicals, laws? Which
        procedures do you plan to employ? If your study does not involve the analysis
        of data at all, you can also indicate that here (but in that case this form
        will probably mostly not be applicable).'

    data_sampling:
      section_id: methods
      item_id: data_sampling
      item_label: Data sampling
      item_description: Describe whether you will sample your data from a larger population.
        If not (i.e. if you will study an entire population), you can also indicatie
        that here. If you do plan to sample from a larger set of potential research
        units, this is where you can describe your sampling procedure, explain why
        that procedure fits with your goals, and explain how you will minimize bias
        (e.g. various forms of selection bias). If you aim to obtain a sample with
        specific characteristics (e.g. stratified according to some variable or optimized
        for heterogeneity in some respects), you can also describe that here, explain
        why you strive for that, and explain why you believe that your procedure will
        achieve your aims.

    data_registration:
      section_id: methods
      item_id: data_registration
      item_label: Data registration
      item_description: Describe how you will register your data. If you will obtain
        your data through measurement, state the measurement instruments that you
        will use and expain your basis for assuming that those measurement instruments
        are appropriate (e.g., given the sample and context of your study). If you
        will not use measurement to obtain your data, explain how you will register
        the data you will use. Here, you can also explain what the data will look
        like after registration, for example by describing the columns in the dataset
        you will analyze, or the media you will use to store your data (e.g. bitrates).

      item_validation: .na.character
    data_bias_minimization:
      section_id: methods
      item_id: data_bias_minimization
      item_label: Data bias minimization
      item_description: Describe whether any procedures are in place to minimize bias
        that may be introduced as data are obtained. For example, will masking be
        applied? If data will be collected by people, will they be masked from the
        implications of patterns in the data for the research questions? If data will
        be collected from people (e.g., archivists, clerks, or research participants),
        will they be masked from the researchers' expectations regarding those data?
        If data are collected by an automated procedure (e.g., scraping websites),
        will the algorithms performing the data collection be vetted by others to
        try to identify biases? If no procedures will be implemented to minimize bias,
        you can also indicate and explain that here.

    data_amount:
      section_id: methods
      item_id: data_amount
      item_label: Amount of data to be collected
      item_description: Describe how much data you plan to collect. For example, here
        you can explain whether you will study one research unit (often referred to
        as a case study), study the entire population, or for anything in between,
        how much data you plan to collect and why. If your data consists of archival
        records, social media data, case law, or chat logs, you can explain how many
        data sources you will analyse. If you will collect qualitative data, you can
        describe how much you plan to collect, and if you use saturation as a stopping
        rule, how you operationalize saturation. If you will conduct quantitative
        analyses, you can describe your sample size computations and which parameters
        you use (e.g. SESOI, alpha, power). In all cases, this is also where you explain
        why that amount of data is appropriate given your aims. If you have no specific
        plans for how much data you will collect, you can also explain that here.

      item_label: Missing data
      item_description: Describe how you plan to deal with missing data (e.g. observations
        that cannot go through as planned, archive materials that cannot be obtained,
        problems with recordings, missing data points, participants who drop out,
        etc).

      item_id: data_validation
      item_label: Data validation
      item_description: Describe your process of ensuring that the data are correct
        and useful (e.g., identifying outliers, establishing correct and valid application
        of measurement instruments, triangulating with other sources, or other methods
        of verifying data integrity). Also describe your criteria for assessing data
        validity and how you will deal with data violating those criteria. Or, if
        you will not assess the correctness, usefulness, or validity of your data,
        you can explain that here.

        an answer to the research question(s). If you distinguish analysis tiers (e.g.,
        primary and secondary analyses, or confirmatory and exploratory analyses),
        list them and indicate which procedures you plan to use for each. Also specify
        what you will do if parts of the plan cannot be properly executed. This is
        also where you can explain your reasons for assuming that your chosen procedure
        is appropriate to arrive at the answers you seek.

      item_label: Criteria for conclusions / inference criteria
      item_description: If you plan to draw your conclusions based on pre-specified
        criteria (e.g., a minimal effect size of interest, a significance level, or
        a saturation point), list these here, explain what they were based on, and
        explain your reasoning. If you plan to draw conclusions but will not use pre-specified
        criteria, you can explain why you will establish criteria later, by what procedure,
        and how you plan to ameliorate the risk of bias. Finally, if you will not
        draw any inferences (e.g., about theories or hypotheses), you can also explain
        that here.
