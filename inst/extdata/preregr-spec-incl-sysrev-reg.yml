  instructions:
  - heading: Intended Use
    description: |-
      This Systematic Review Registration Form is intended as a general-purpose registration form. The form is designed to be applicable to reviews across disciplines (i.e., psychology, economics, law, physics, or any other field) and across review types (i.e., scoping review, review of qualitative studies, meta-analysis, or any other type of review). That means that the reviewed records may include research reports as well as archive documents, case law, books, poems, etc. This form, therefore, is a fall-back for more specialized forms and can be used if no specialized form or registration platform is available. Below are some currently available specialized registration tools you may consider:

      **Specialized Registration Platforms**:
      - PROSPERO is a database of review protocols for health-related systematic reviews.

      **Specialized Guidance**:
      - The Non-Interventional, Reproducible, and Open (NIRO) Systematic Reviews guideline also includes fields specific to non-interventional reviews.
  - heading: Relation to reporting guidelines
    description: "Many disciplines have developed reporting guidelines for specific
      types of reviews (e.g., ROSES: the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence
      Syntheses in environmental research, and PRISMA: the Preferred Reporting Items
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Whereas reporting guidelines were
      optimized for application after conclusion of a systematic review, this form
      was optimized to publicly register (‘freeze’) the research plans (or to record
      adjustments to research plans) before (or during) a systematic review. These
      different end goals resulted in different choices regarding included items.
      For example, this form includes a number of questions about planning that are
      important for a registration but typically not included in reporting guidelines.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
      these reporting guidelines do partly capture the same information as registration
      forms. For each item in this form, we specified the corresponding PRISMA item
      (PRISMA items P1-P22 and P25-27 were applicable; P16-P23 cover reporting of
      results and P24 refers to registration forms like this). Researchers planning
      to use a specific reporting standard to report the results of their review,
      should enter the information required by that reporting standard in the corresponding
      (overarching) fields of this form. \r"
  - heading: Instructions for effectively using the form
    description: "Due to the general intended use of this form, items may not be applicable
      to all types of reviews. Therefore, none of the items are mandatory (note, however,
      that core items have been marked with a star: <U+2B50>). However, the more items you
      can complete in detail, the more useful your registration will be so check carefully
      whether you did not accidently omit an item. If an item asks about a procedure
      you do not plan to use or is not applicable, indicate that in the corresponding
      field (including, ideally, the underlying reason).\r\n\r\nYou should be transparent
      about any deviations from the preregistration and provide the rationale for
      these deviations in your final review. If you already foresee some deviations
      when filling out the form (e.g., you anticipate that you will not have enough
      studies in a moderator group), provide a contingency plan for these deviations
      in the relevant parts of the registration.\r"
  - heading: Planned improvements / extensions
    description: "The aim of this registration form is to be optimally inclusive (i.e.,
      to be usable for registration of any systematic review, regardless of scientific
      discipline or review type). Because this aim precludes 1:1 correspondence with
      the existing reporting guidelines, this form is also intended as a basis to
      develop more specialized forms that do correspond closely to more specific reporting
      guidelines. Such specialized can include, for example, additional fields, added
      comments, and worked examples. Please contact the Center of Open Science at
      contact@cos.io if you would like to propose such a specialized version. Below
      you can find the currently planned improvements/extensions including contact
      information of the person leading the project. Please do reach out if you want
      to be involved in any of these projects!\r\n\r\n- A template specifically tailored
      to meta-analyses in the social sciences, including a tutorial and a worked example
      (lead: Olmo van den Akker, ovdakker@gmail.com)\r\n- Extend explicit linking
      to items in other reporting guidelines than PRISMA"

        pragmatic considerations with scientific rigour. Here, describe the justifications

        how do you know those are feasible), your data integrity and missing data
        checks and corrections, your synthesis plan, the criteria you chose to drive
        your conclusions/inferences (if any), and your procedures for blinding, and
        reliability assurance/reconciliation if you use multiple synthesists. PRISMA:

      section_description: 'In this section, you register your plans for data extraction:
        the procedures you designed to extract the data you are interested in from
        the included sources. Examples of such data are text fragments, effect sizes,
        study design characteristics, year of publication, characteristics of measurement

      section_description: 'In this section, you register the procedure for the review’s
        synthesis: the procedure you designed to use the data that was extracted from
        each source to answer your research question(s). This often includes transforming
        the raw extracted data, verifying validity, interpreting the results, applying
        predefined inference criteria, and the presentation of results. Additionally,
        you register the procedures you designed to assess bias in individual sources
        as well as the synthesis itself.'
