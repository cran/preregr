\description{
As an international effort toward increasing psychologyâ€™s commitment to
creating a stronger culture and practice of preregistration, a
multi-society Preregistration Task Force* was formed, following the
2018 meeting of the German Psychological Society in Frankfurt, Germany.
The Task Force created a detailed preregistration template that benefited
from the APA JARS Quantitative Research guidelines, as well as a
comprehensive review of many other preregistration templates.
